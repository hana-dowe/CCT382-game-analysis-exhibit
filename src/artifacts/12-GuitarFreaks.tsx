    'Guitar Freaks is a rhythm game where you play notes on the guitar controller. You have to play the notes on the guitar as it shows up on screen so that the sounds match up with the song.',

    'The controller is a guitar with colourful buttons on its neck and a bar to press where you would strum on a real one',

    <p>
      Theoretically, players shouldnâ€™t want controllers to be heavier than they need to be, but
      guitar controllers are an exception. In Guitar Freakâ€™s case, the controller creates more
      immersion than the game. The gameâ€™s UI is also dependent on the fact that the controller is a
      guitar because the screen only shows the neck of the guitar. The screen on its own does not
      look too different from a plain old rhythm game. Without the guitar controller, the game would
      feel something more basic like rhythm game freaks.
