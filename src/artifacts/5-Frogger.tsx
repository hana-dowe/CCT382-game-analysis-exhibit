    <p>
      This Frogger arcade controller tells users how the control will work without making them read
      a single word. When you tilt the joystick, the frog on the screen will move in the same
      direction as the drawing. This is the first controller in the analysis that does this. It
      doesn‚Äôt put big words in your face like the Computer Space control panel and isn‚Äôt
      explanation-less like the Atari 2600. The video game community is growing, so the users are
      developing a better idea of what a video game controller usually does, and needs fewer
      instructions form the developers.
