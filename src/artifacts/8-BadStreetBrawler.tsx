      <p>
        This time, Nintendo attempted to take on virtual reality. A motion-sensing controller being
        connected by a wire limits its ability to move around. But that didnâ€™t really matter since
        the motion sensing barely worked in the first place. (Cronin, 2020).{' '}

        Although you could use it for any game, only two games were specifically designed with the
        glove in mind, one of which was Bad Street Brawler. You were supposed to be able to mimic
        punching movements to fight opponents with the glove. But its inaccuracy and spotty
        connection only made the game harder and frustrating for its users. Instead of increasing
        immersion in the game like we hoped the glove would, it did the opposite by obstructing the
        player from performing actions they would have otherwise been able to do on a regular
        controller.

      <p>
        The concept was cool and exciting, it definitely would have gone better if the budget and
        technology allowed for its proper development at the time.
