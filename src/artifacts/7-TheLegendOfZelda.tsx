      <p>
        Nintendo decided to add microphone input as a new method of taking control of your game.
        With the hands-free input through the mic, you could use not only your hands as input but
        your voice as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Legend of Zelda incorporated this feature by creating an enemy called Pols Voice which
        is afraid of loud noises (Bertoli, 2020). If you make a loud sound while there are Pols
        Voice on the map, it will automatically defeat them. By making the player use more of
        themselves to play the game, it makes them more engaged in the game.
