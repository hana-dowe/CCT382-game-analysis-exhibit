      <p>
        This is the first console that has come up in this analysis. The controller now needs to
        work for multiple different games, so we cannot glue instructions onto them anymore. The
        original Space Invaders arcade used circular left and right buttons, but the Atari 2600 uses
        a joystick which is more intuitive for movement.
      </p>

        Although the concept of using a joystick may have sparked joy, the Atari 2600 joystick was
        not suited for people with larger hands (Classic Game Room, 2008). Typically, you would want
        to grab onto the whole stick to get a good grip, but the controller is too small for the
        hands of adults. This could lead to having less control of your character, discouraging
        people from playing.
      </p>
      <p>
        But on a good note, Space Invaders was the first to introduce meaningful sound effects to
        video games (Donahoe, 2017). This is a huge innovation, as it gives more feedback to players
        when they press a button.
