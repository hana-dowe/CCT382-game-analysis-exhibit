    <p>
      Gamers quickly caught on to how much more control you are able to get with the mouse since
      doom, as it didn‚Äôt even take a year for a game to be released with mouse movement as the
      default camera configuration. Marathon was the first game to introduce freelook, allowing
      players to look 360 degrees with the movement of their mouse (Guinness World Records, 1994). I
      personally think freelook is what makes PC games game-changers, due to the sheer amount of
      visibility and precision you can get.
